We import plt from matplotlib.pyplot

.pyplot contains a number of functions that help us generate charts and graphs

plt.title("Square Numbers", fontsize=24) - Gives PLT a title
plt.xlabel("Value", fontsize=14) - Gives X axis a name
plt.ylabel("Square of value", fontsize=14) - Gives y axis a name

#Pygal

Graph for random walk

graph = pygal.XY() - Scatter Plot
we need to Zip the X and Y values in order to display it
formatted_xy = list(zip(my_walk.x_values,my_walk.y_values))

graph.add("Name of what's added", formatted_xy)


#Usefull shit !!!

[next(f) for i in range(12)]
headings = next(f)

does next() 11 times and the next next() is the best next()

You can also use readlines

line = f.readlines()
heading = line[12]
#Altough I don't know if it will pick up from line 12 as the next() function does
